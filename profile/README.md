# A message from the co-founders of Cloud Atlas

My name is Muness and a co-founder of Cloud Atlas: By day, I am a Director of Data Engineering at NerdWallet. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/muness). I've worked at JPMC, Shopify, Zapier to name a few high profile names. My personal mission is to help people do things of which they are proud. 

Drazen and I have been working together professionally for over five years. We want our teams to do great stuff, but without a lot of nonsense, fun and innovation stifling process we've seen.

Cloud Atlas is a side hustle, where we are building out the tools we use into productivity systems others value and pay for. We also offer free productivity tools, for now, helping people integrate their tools with our favorite editor, Obsidian.
